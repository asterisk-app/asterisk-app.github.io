# The Data Privacy Crisis: Why I Created Asterisk

In today's digital landscape, our personal data has become the most valuable commodity. What was once a simple exchange of information has transformed into a complex ecosystem where corporations harvest our interactions, conversations, and behaviors for profit. This realization was the catalyst for creating **Asterisk**. A simple, secure and self-hosted end-to-end encrypted chat application designed to put control back in users' hands.

## Data is the New Oil

The comparison between data and oil is not merely metaphorical. It reflects the enormous value corporations place on our personal information. Major tech companies have demonstrated time and again that user data is worth billions:

When Meta (formerly Facebook) acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, they weren't simply purchasing a messaging app with limited revenue. They were investing in access to user data, behaviors, and networks that could be monetized through their advertising ecosystem.

More recently, Mozilla, long considered a champion of user privacy, announced changes to their privacy policy that raised concerns among users who had trusted them to prioritize data protection. This shift demonstrates how difficult it is for even well-intentioned organizations to resist the financial incentives of data collection.

Perhaps most concerning is how our digital footprintsâ€”our blog posts, YouTube videos, and Reddit discussionsâ€”have been scraped without meaningful consent to train Large Language Models like ChatGPT. These companies generate substantial profits from models trained on content created by users who receive no compensation for their contributions.

## Can We Trust Corporate Giants?

This pattern raises a critical question: Can we truly trust large corporations with our private communications? History suggests we should be skeptical.

The business model of "free" services like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Discord follows a concerning pattern. When a product is offered at no financial cost, users themselves often become the productâ€”their data packaged and sold to advertisers or used to train proprietary algorithms.

While these services may offer convenience, they typically do so at the expense of privacy. Their terms of service frequently include provisions allowing them to analyze message metadata or even message content for business purposes.

## Government Surveillance and Encryption

Beyond corporate interests, government access to private communication represents another significant concern. While national security justifications often sound reasonable, the potential for misuse depends entirely on who holds power:

- China has implemented sweeping bans on end-to-end encrypted messaging applications, forcing citizens to use government-approved platforms where authorities can access communications.

- The United Kingdom has introduced legislation that would effectively weaken encryption through "backdoors," allowing government agencies to access encrypted messages.

- France has begun similar discussions about restricting robust encryption, citing security concerns while downplaying privacy implications.

- Many other countries have already banned or severely restricted access to secure messaging platforms, limiting citizens' ability to communicate privately.

# Introducing Asterisk: A Solution for Private Communication

As a response to these challenges, I created **Asterisk**â€”a secure, simple, and self-hosted end-to-end encrypted chat application designed for individuals and small groups concerned about their communication privacy.

You might wonder, "Why not just use **Signal**? It's open-source, popular, and considered the gold standard for secure messaging." This is a valid question, but Signal presents significant limitations.

While Signal's code is open-source, self-hosting the Signal server is notoriously difficult. The process requires significant technical expertise.

Even if you manage to self-host a Signal server, using it with the official mobile and desktop clients requires rebuilding those applications with modified endpointsâ€”a substantial technical challenge.

Most people simply don't have the time for these complex technical procedures. Communication security shouldn't require a computer science degree.

## The Asterisk Advantage

**Asterisk** addresses these challenges with a different approach. It's designed as a plug-and-play solution where all configuration can be managed in a single file. Sharing your secure communication network with friends or family only requires sharing an endpoint URL.

This simplicity comes with significant benefits:

**Government-resistant by design:** Since you control your own server, there's no easy way for governments to ban your application or access your data through legal demands to a central service provider.

**Minimal data storage:** By default, the server stores only registered user email addresses. Encrypted messages might be temporarily stored when waiting to be delivered to offline users, but they're deleted once delivered, meaning the server retains very little sensitive information.

**True end-to-end encryption:** Your messages are encrypted on your device before transmission and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient's device, ensuring that not even the server administrator can read your communications.

Asterisk represents a balanced approach to secure communicationâ€”providing the privacy benefits of end-to-end encryption with the practical usability needed for widespread adoption.

# Conclusion

In an era where our data is constantly harvested and our privacy regularly compromised, tools like **Asterisk** are increasingly essential. By creating a secure messaging platform that anyone can deploy and control, my goal is to democratize communication privacy and return control to users.

Whether you're concerned about corporate data collection, government surveillance, or simply value your privacy as a fundamental right, **Asterisk** offers a practical solution that doesn't require exceptional technical skills.

The future of private communication shouldn't be controlled by corporations or governmentsâ€”it should be in the hands of individuals. **Asterisk** is my contribution toward making that future a reality.
